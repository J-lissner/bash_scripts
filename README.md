# Bash scripts

Contains some bash scripts with convenient functions.   
For each script there are appropriate examples given.  
Each script has a -h or --help option for an explanation of the script.  

So far implemented:  
    - Various compilation methods for *.tex files  
    - Multiple file manipulation for insertion/swapping of headers  

Once the scripts have been downloaded, the permissions most likely need to be changed to be executable on your computer.

Recommended way of usage:  
 Copy the scripts in /some/directory/with/scripts/  
 Edit your ~/.bashrc and add the following line:  
 PATH=/some/directory/with/scripts    
 Now the scripts can be executed in any directory with "scriptname.sh [-options] args", no ./scriptname required.
