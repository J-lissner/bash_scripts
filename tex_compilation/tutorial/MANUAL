### Copy the commands into your terminal for the tutorial ############
### It is assumed that you have added the scripts to your $PATH (in the .bashrc) and they can be simply executed
### (for easier copy pasting, you can also paste the commented lines into your terminal, nothing will happen)

### we have these tex files
cat *tex

### lets try to compile every file with xelatex. Note that you have to press enter through some errors
xltx.sh
###############
### As you can see, calling the script tries to compile every tex file it finds
### It does continue upon a failed compilation (a_plot.tex), and removes every debuggin file at the end
### Every tex compilation script has the -k option, to keep the debugging files
### Every tex compilation script tries to compile every *tex file it finds with no specified arguments
### With specified arguments, every tex compilation script does only compile the given scripts.
###############

### you may look at some pdfs, though for further introduction they are deleted again
rm *pdf

### Compiling both 'document' files with xelatex:
xltx.sh -k document*.tex

#equivalent to #xltx.sh -k document1.tex document2.tex


### Both files compiled and we have a bunch of additional files in our folder
### cleaning up and removing these "debugging files"
rm_textrail.sh

### Now that we have a better overview, lets have a look at the compiled pdfs

### Now we start over and compile document2.tex correctly
rm *.pdf

xebibtx.sh document2.tex
ls *pdf
evince document2.pdf &

### note that all the debugging files have been automatically removed, and we only have compiled the specified file
### which did work. Although we don't see the aux file anymore, the bib did successfully compile


### now we compile the "a_plot" file
gnup-pdf.sh -k a_plot.tex
evince a_plot.pdf &

### note that it first ran gnuplot that the eps file was created, then the tex file got successfully compiled
### and with the -k option, the debugging files sticked around
rm *eps
rm a_plot.pdf

###compiling it again with only the gnuplot file
gnup-pdf.sh a_plot.gp
evince a_plot.pdf &

### and again, we see the correct pdf
### If we run the gnup-pdf.sh file without any arguments, it also tries to compile the other two tex files, although they have no corresponding *gp file.

### resetting the examples folder
rm *pdf
rm *eps
rm_textrail.sh

###For a short summary, read the lines 10-16
