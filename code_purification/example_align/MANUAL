### For the tutorial, copy this text into your terminal
### it is assumed you have put the script in your $PATH, such that it can be run without the ./ declaration

cat -n "example_code"
echo "################ ORIGINAL FILE ###############"

### if we run the script we can directly see its effect

align_code.sh example_code
cat -n "example_code"

### The code is commented to make you aware of the scripts shortcomings

### the script does save a backup by default
### we can suppress the backup with the '-nb' option
ls example_code.bak
rm example_code.bak
cp originals/example_code .
### Set the files back to the original files
align_code.sh -nb example_code
ls example_code.bak
### no backup has been saved

### reset the tutorial to the original files
rm example_code.bak
cp originals/example_code .
